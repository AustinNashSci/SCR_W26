## Chapter 1
SCR is an extension to capture recapture methods, but also allows for the integration of a wide array of data types and ecological theory.
Common data streams used in SCR analyses include camera traps, DNA sampling, and acoustic recorders.
While typical data streams revolve around static detectors, search encounter methods such as detection dog surveys can be used in an SCR framework.
Encounter histories are commonly represented by a matrix with rows representing individuals and columns representing sampling events.
Authors present a motivating example of using traditional CR methods to estimate the density of bears. 
Going from N individuals to density requires strong assumptions, and density estimates vary widely based on the method selected. 
Traditional methods can't account for differences in exposure to detectors of individuals based on the location of their activity centers.
Traditional CR cannot accomadate trap level covariates. 
THe classical approach to estimating density involves adding a buffer to the MCP of the trap grid that is 0.5 times the size of the mean maximum distance moved. 
Another approach to correcting biases in traditional CR models is by using telemetry to estiamte how often an animal temporarily emigrates from the trapping area. 
Another CR bias correction approach is using distance to edge of the trapping grid as an individual covariate on detectability, which is an intermediate step to full SCR.

Efford 2004 is the first formulation of a spatially explicit CR. 
This involved a point process model formulation and equated the observation process to a distance sampling problem. 
Observations of individuals represent a imperfectly observed, or thinned, point process. 
Another formalization is activity centers being parent nodes, with locations of individuals being child nodes, which is a poisson cluster process. 
Authors use the term home range and activity center interchangeably. 
SCR does not require the organism to be a central place forager, the activity center is essentially equivalent to a utilization distribution. 
The possible values of all activity center points are referred to as the state space. 
$$D = \frac {N}{A(S)} $$

## Chapter 2
Primarily review, covers the basics of statistical inference.
Review of probability notation, random variables, common distributions

Multinomial distribution - commonly used in CR studies to model the encounter histories of individuals. 
Each category is each possible encounter history. 
The multinomial is used in scr to model when an individual can only be caught in a single trap in an ocassion (like for box traps, unlike camera traps), N = 1 and the cell probabillities are the probability of being captured in each trap.
The categorical distribution is the special case of the multinomial with N = 1.
