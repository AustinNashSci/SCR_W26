## Chapter 1
SCR is an extension to capture recapture methods, but also allows for the integration of a wide array of data types and ecological theory.
Common data streams used in SCR analyses include camera traps, DNA sampling, and acoustic recorders.
While typical data streams revolve around static detectors, search encounter methods such as detection dog surveys can be used in an SCR framework.
